# odin-inventory-app

The Odin Inventory Project is a web-based application built using TypeScript and React for the front-end, Axios for API calls, and Razorpay as the third-party payment gateway.

The main feature of the application is to allow users to purchase products by sending the product ID and amount to the third-party payment gateway for verification and processing. The APIs used in the application are responsible for creating and verifying the order placed by the user.
